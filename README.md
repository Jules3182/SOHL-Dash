# Welcome to SOHL-Dash
## (The Significant Other HomeLab Dashboard)

Ever had to try and talk your wife through restarting the headless plex server hidden in the basement or explain to grandpa why his “internet tv” stopped working? This might be exactly what you’ve been looking for!

The goal of this project is to create a super simple, powerful, and customizable dashboard to help your less tech savvy loved ones “manage” your heavily modified network set up. No ISP or Best Buy calls, no lengthy yet somehow vague texts about the wifi, no frustration; just simplified troubleshooting options at their fingertips. Slap a QR code to the dashboard near the ol’ “internet box” and they’ll feel like elite hackers in no time!

## Feature Ideas:
- NTFY integration to let you know when they tried something
- Different themes
- Automatically detecting problems on load (overheating, no internet connection, container crash, etc.)
- Users/experience levels for varying amounts of information/options (very simple, like buttons with emojis or could be preset in config)
- Use log with user and action
- Standalone capabilities (throw it on a pi and leave it at your grandparents house to run on its own)


## Feature List:

#### Version 0.0.1
